							JavaScript is the world most popular

							Java Programming Language
						</h1>
						<p class="text-small">
							When compared with C++, Java codes
							are generally more maintainable
							because Java does not allow many
							things which may lead to
							bad/inefficient programming if used
							incorrectly. For example,
							non-primitives are always references
							in Java. So we cannot pass large
							objects (like we can do in C++) to
							functions, we always pass references
							in Java. One more example, since there
							are no pointers, bad memory access
							is also not possible. When compared
							with Python, Java kind of fits between
							C++ and Python. The programs are written
							in Java typically run faster than
							corresponding Python programs and slower
							than C++. Like C++, Java does static
							type checking, but Python does not.

							Machine Learning is the field of study
							that gives computers the capability to
							learn without being explicitly
							programmed. ML is one of the most exciting
							technologies that one would have ever
							come across. As it is evident from the
							name, it gives the computer that makes
							it more similar to humans: The ability
							to learn. Machine learning is actively
